# Course Description
Data plays a central and important role in modern society. Nearly every web search, phone call, transaction, and countless other activities are tracked, analyzed, and used to predict future actions. Data science is a collection of analytical and computational methods to enable insight, understanding and predictions to be drawn from data. This course provides an introduction to the methods of data science, including visualization, manipulation, programming and modeling, in the context of social justice. All work will be done in R or RStudio.

# Curricular Connections
This course satisfies the graduation requirement in Justice, Equality, and Community. It is also an introductory course for the Data Science minor, and satisfies the Mathematical & Quantitative Thought distribution requirement.

# Prerequisites
This is a first course in data science. There are no prerequisites. I will assume no previous experience with R, computer programming or any other aspect of data science.

# Course Materials & Tools
## Software
You will use two freely available programs, R and RStudio, in order to complete the assignments for this course. R and RStudio are installed on all Davidson campus computers, and they are also freely available to download on your personal computers.
