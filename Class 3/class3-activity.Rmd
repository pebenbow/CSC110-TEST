## Read in Chetty data
```{r}

```


## Look for correlations
1. Visualize the relationship between social capital and absolute mobility. Do you see a correlation? Is it what you expected from the Chetty study executive summary?

2. Add an aesthetic to your graph to represent whether the CZ is urban or not. Do your results suggest that Simpson's paradox could be an issue?

3. Separate urban and non-urban CZ's into two separate plots.

4. Add a smooth fit to each of your plots above. Experiment with adding the option method="lm" in your geom_smooth. What does this option do?

```{r}
  
```
5. Repeat the above plots for relative mobility. What differences do you observe?

```{r}

```

6. Repeat the above plots for a different variable that was highly correlated with economic mobility.
```{r}

```
